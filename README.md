## Descrption 
### User Story
AS a coffee lover -
I WANT an app that will allow myself to post and share new coffee around the area with the best prices
SO THAT I can also save money while telling others about the best (or worst) coffee I’ve had around the world 

(who doesn’t love to save money?)

## How it works

Users can visit the application from anywhere.  On the home page, there is a display of the last drink and shop that was rated along with the most popular shops display.  There is a log in button and a sign up button. 

Once a user has signed/logged in it will take them to the search page.  At the search page, the user will be able to search for drinks or shops.  There will also be a display for history of posted drinks/shops by the user.
